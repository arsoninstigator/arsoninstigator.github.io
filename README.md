# personal website 
this is the code for my personal website created using html/css and minimal vanilla js. i initially made the website for #bobadrops but then just kept updating it. i mostly just talk about myself, play around with the code and tried to implement new features or cool things i see on the internet. it's a **pretty basic** static website and the image on the home page is not my own. 

you can find a preview of the website (as of 09/11) below :

you can find the website live at [arsoninstigator.github.io](arsoninstigator.github.io) or [arson.dino.icu](https://arson.dino.icu/)
